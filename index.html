    <h2>Data Shared</h2>
    <p>The only data that other users and our backend can see is that you've confessed or replied to another person's confession. Nobody can see who you confessed to, and neither of you are notified unless you have a mutual crush. Slack authentication is only to identify who you select.</p>
    <p>The entire database is public and loaded into the frontend <u>because it can be</u>. There's not enough information to decrypt who has confessed who.</p>
    <h2>Technical Explanation</h2>
